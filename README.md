## Purpose
Our bot tracks the mood of your Slack channel in real time, and identifies for you where coworkers may not be particularly friendly. We are using a sentiment analysis algorithm from https://algorithmia.com, and each message's sentiment is rated according to that algorithm.

# Setup

First, clone the respository and enter it.
```
$ git clone <url>
$ cd SlackSentiment
```

Set up the virtual environment (with python 2.7!) and config file.
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp python-rtmbot-master/rtmbot.conf.example python-rtmbot-master/rtmbot.conf
```

Create a Slack Bot and get the API token here.
```
https://YOURWORKSPACEHERE.slack.com/apps/build/custom-integration
```

Create an Algorithmia account and get an API token here.
```
https://algorithmia.com/
````

Update python-rtmbot-master/rtmbot.conf with your API keys from Slack and Algorithmia.

```
DEBUG: True

SLACK_TOKEN: "YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN"
ALGORITHMIA_KEY: "YOUR_ALGORITHMIA_KEY"
```

Enter the python-rtmbot-master directory and run the rtmbot.
```
$ cd python-rtmbot-master
$ python rtmbot.py
```
Check your Slack channel, and your bot will appear online.

# Usage

The results from the analysis are in the form of:

* Negative
* Neutral
* Postitive

### Bot Commands

```



Second,

```bot function?```

This command will display what this bot is used for such as:
